# Embedded Game Console

This repository contains the codebase for an **LCD Character Display Game Console** project. The code is designed to run on a custom-built embedded device, featured in the video below. The project challenged me to make the most of minimal hardware.
The modular software design allows easy addition or swapping of new games, as long as device storage permits. Overall, a fun project to practice embedded programming using Arduino.
